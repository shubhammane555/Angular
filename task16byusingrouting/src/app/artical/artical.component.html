              The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an
              information system enabling documents and other web resources to
              be accessed over the Internet.[1] Documents and downloadable media
              are made available to the network through web servers and can be
              accessed by programs such as web browsers. Servers and resources
              on the World Wide Web are identified and located through character
              strings called uniform resource locators (URLs). The original and
              still very common document type is a web page formatted in
              Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). This markup language supports
              plain text, images, embedded video and audio contents, and scripts
              (short programs) that implement complex user interaction. The HTML
              language also supports hyperlinks (embedded URLs) which provide
              immediate access to other web resources. Web navigation, or web
              surfing, is the common practice of following such hyperlinks
              across multiple websites. Web applications are web pages that
              function as application software. The information in the Web is
              transferred across the Internet using the Hypertext Transfer
              Protocol (HTTP). Multiple web resources with a common theme and
              usually a common domain name make up a website. A single web
              server may provide multiple websites, while some websites,
              especially the most popular ones, may be provided by multiple
              servers. Website content is provided by a myriad of companies,
              organizations, government agencies, and individual users; and
              comprises an enormous amount of educational, entertainment,
              commercial, and government information. The World Wide Web has
              become the world's dominant software platform.[2][3][4][5] It is
              the primary tool billions of people worldwide use to interact with
              the Internet.[6] The Web was originally conceived as a document
              management system.[7] It was invented by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN
              in 1989 and opened to the public in 1991.
